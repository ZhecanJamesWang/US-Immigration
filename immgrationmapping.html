                    For the first visualization, we wanted to see where immigrants went when they got here and how connected they were. We initially thought that we wanted to explore the spatial component as well as the time component. So we thought that the best solution to this was a map that changed over time. We created a heat map where the more immigrants a state has, the redder it is and the less immigrants a state has, the blue or colder it is. 

                    The data used to produce these results are the number of legal permanent residents of each foreign born population in each state divided by the other states each Asian could go to. This would tell the story of why Asians concentrated in each state over each of the other states. This is an interesting part about Data Science, what you normalize is so important to the story you are trying to tell

                    You can find the visualization here: <a href = "https://immigrationmapping.herokuapp.com/"> https://immigrationmapping.herokuapp.com/</a>

                    What we noticed was the usual that Latin Americans went to the south and those states got darker. We also noticed that Asians and such went to tech hubs like California, Pittsburg, and New York. This told us kind of what we already knew. So we kind of got to thinking about what we were missing, what did we not already know? 

                    This led us to explore the idea of how many and of which foreign born group each state expects to receive? Is this actually what they received? Where do the legal permanent residents actually reside? Read the next blog post to see where we went!
