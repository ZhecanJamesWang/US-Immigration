                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                        While Nur, Filippos, and James are looking into US government and societal interactions with immigrants and other newcomers, we are exploring what immigrants do once they live here. This includes learning more about their integration into society in terms of employment, educational attainment, living conditions, and other related areas over time. Through analyzing and visualizing this information, we hope to gain more insight into societal trends and how they may be impacted by cultural motivation or regional context. Using the other group’s findings of how the government, media, and society have received immigrants in both policies and overall opinions, our end goal is to create a cohesive story of immigration in the US through the past few years, and how government policies, society, and culture interact with and influence each other .

                    </p>

                    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
                    <p>
                        We have been utilizing the US Census Bureau’s American Factfinder tables. Their information comes from various consensuses and surveys polling the people every year, asking them about themselves.  More specifically, we have been looking the tables of Selected Characteristics of Foreign Born Populations from 2005 to 2014. These tables exist for foreign born populations from: Africa, Northern America (not the USA), Oceania, Asia, Europe, and Latin America. This data set has information for all of these foreign born populations from years 2005 to 2014 for characteristics such as average household size, percentage of people in each marital status category (single, married, divorced, widowed), percentage of people naturalized, citizenship and period of entry, school enrollment rates, higher educational attainment rates, occupation rates, popular workforce industry rates, poverty rates, and income sources. This is an immense amount of data to work with, and we are happily parsing through it. The major challenge has been that the data downloads into a 2 rows by 1743 columns data frame, where each value in this data frame is accessed with a unique code, and each value corresponds to a unique cell in the original table. Therefore, this is a tedious data set to parse through. Up until this point, we have been exploring income and industry of work as well as education attained for foreigns from Asia, Northern America, Oceania, and Africa for the year 2014.

                    <h2>Education Obtained</h2>
                    <h3> School Enrollement Breakdown for Year 2014 </h3>
                    First we explored the school enrollement for all people born in Asia, Eastern Asia, South Central Asia, and Western Asia for the year 2014. The data table says that there are 483, 655 Asians attending school in 2014. Out of those 483, 655, below is the break down of how many students are in nursery school, elementary school, high school, or college. 

                    The data for the rest of the foreign born people born in Asia looks like this: 
                    <table>
                        <tr> <td> <b> Foreign Born People </b></td> <td> <b> Total Attending School </b> </td> </tr>
                        <tr> <td> Born in Asia </td> <td> 2,092,371 </td> </tr>
                        <tr> <td> Born in Eastern Asia </td> <td> 785,252 </td> </tr>
                        <tr> <td> Born in South Central Asia </td> <td> 535,263 </td> </tr>
                        <tr> <td> Born in South Eastern Asia </td> <td> 524,544 </td> </tr>
                        <tr> <td> Born in Western Asia </td> <td> 242,584 </td> </tr>
                        <tr> <td> Born in Africa </td> <td> 483,665 </td> </tr>
                        <tr> <td> Born in Northern America (not including USA) </td> <td> 92,127</td> </tr>
                        <tr> <td> Born in Oceania </td> <td> 37,685 </td> </tr>
                    </table>


                    Now we can look at which grades these foreign born people are attending. The data set had the percentage of total people born in each foreign country listed above attending nursery school, elementary school, high school, or college. 

                    <figure align = 'center'> 
                            <figcaption> The number of foreign born people born all around Asia attending these different grades. </figcaption>
                            <img src = 'img/asia_enrolled_in_school_pie.png' width = "150%">
                    </figure>

                    According to this breakdown, very small number of children are enrolled in nursery school, but a large number are enrolled in college. This tells us that children that immigrate to the United States are old enough to attend elementary school or college, but not nursery school. Oddly enough, consistently there are more children enrolled in elmentary school or college than there are enrolled in high school. It's not like high school is optional once you get to America. Therefore, I think that this speaks to two "waves" of immigrants, those that come for elementary school and stay until or past college. Then those that come as part of their college studies. 


                    <figure align = 'center'> 
                            <figcaption> The number of foreign born people born in Africa, Northern America, and Oceania attending these different grades. </figcaption>
                            <img src = 'img/africa_na_and_oceania_enrolled_in_school_pie.png' width = "100%">
                    </figure>

                    According to this data, very small number of children born in Africa, Northern America, and Oceania are in nursery school. Again, this is likely due to the fact that parents do not immigrate with children until they are a bit older than nursery school perhaps. The majority of Africa, Northern American, and Oceania foreign born people are enrolled in college. This says something about the education in the United States, that perhaps a major reason for immigrating into the United States is the quality of a higher education. Again, more students are enrolled in elemetary school or college than high school. This is odd. Therefore, we should keep exploring and comparing these data sets.Particularly, let us zoom in on college and higher education.

                    <h3> Degrees Obtained Breakdown for Year 2014</h3>

                    The data set contains the percentages of Asians, Eastern Asians, South Central Asians, South Eastern Asians, and Western Asians that have less than a high school degree in education, a high school degree, some college like an associates degree, a bachelors degree, and a graduate degree. 

                    We can plot the percentage of Asian people that have obtained each type of degree. 

                    <p>
                        <figure align = 'center'> 
                            <figcaption> Degrees obtained by People </figcaption>
                            <img src = 'img/degrees_obtained_by_asians.png' width = "100%">
                        </figure>
                    </p>

                    We noticed that South Eastern people have the majority in the less than high school education group. They are, however, the second highest group in a bachelor's degree. The people from South Central Asia consistently have the least number of people with less than high school degrees and high school degrees. On those lines, they also consistently have the highest number of people with the majority of bachelor and graduate degrees. 

                    <figure align = 'center'> 
                            <figcaption> Degrees obtained by People </figcaption>
