                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                        While Nur, Filippos, and James are looking into US government and societal interactions with immigrants and other newcomers, we are exploring what immigrants do once they live here. This includes learning more about their integration into society in terms of employment, educational attainment, living conditions, and other related areas over time. Through analyzing and visualizing this information, we hope to gain more insight into societal trends and how they may be impacted by cultural motivation or regional context. Using the other group’s findings of how the government, media, and society have received immigrants in both policies and overall opinions, our end goal is to create a cohesive story of immigration in the US through the past few years, and how government policies, society, and culture interact with and influence each other.

                    </p>

                    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
                    <p>
                        We have been utilizing the US Census Bureau’s American Factfinder tables. Their information comes from various consensuses and surveys polling the people every year, asking them about themselves.  More specifically, we have been looking the tables of Selected Characteristics of Foreign Born Populations from 2005 to 2014. These tables exist for foreign born populations from: Africa, Northern America (not the USA), Oceania, Asia, Europe, and Latin America. This data set has information for all of these foreign born populations from years 2005 to 2014 for characteristics such as average household size, percentage of people in each marital status category (single, married, divorced, widowed), percentage of people naturalized, citizenship and period of entry, school enrollment rates, higher educational attainment rates, occupation rates, popular workforce industry rates, poverty rates, and income sources. This is an immense amount of data to work with, and we are happily parsing through it. The major challenge has been that the data downloads into a 2 rows by 1743 columns data frame, where each value in this data frame is accessed with a unique code, and each value corresponds to a unique cell in the original table. Therefore, this is a tedious data set to parse through. Up until this point, we have been exploring income and industry of work as well as education attained for foreigns from Asia, Northern America, Oceania, and Africa for the year 2014. 

                    </p>

                    <h3>Areas We've Looked At</h3>
                    <p>Throughout the rest of this post, we will refer to different regions of the world. Below are a few maps to show how each area is defined:</p>

                            <td width="50%">
                                <figure>
                                    <figcaption>Asia:</figcaption>
                                    <img src='img/asia.png' width="60%">

                        </tr>
                    </table>
                    <p>
                        Within Asia, we look at the following regions:
                    </p>
                    <figure align="center">
                        <figcaption>West (light green), South Central (orange), South East (blue), and East (dark green):</figcaption>
                        <img src='img/asia_regions.png' width="100%">
                    </figure>

                    *Note: all maps are sourced from Wikipedia

                    <h2>Income and Employment in 2014</h2>
                    <p> 
                        One of the most obvious areas for us to explore first was what kind of jobs different immigrant groups have, what their employment and income rates look like, and how that compares to the overall US population (including all immigrant groups). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We began by looking at a breakdown of the percentage of the population over 16 years old who are in the labor force and who are not: 
                    </p>
                    <figure>
                        <figcaption>Labor Force Breakdown by Origin:</figcaption>
                        <img src='img/pop_in_labor_force.png' width="100%">
                    </figure>

                    <p> 
                        African immigrants are the most likely to go into the labor force as they arrive, indicating either older immigrants or more who have already completed some schooling past high school. North Americans are more evenly split, with a majority in the labor force but 43.8% not. This could be due to several factors: younger ages of immigrants, larger families with only one working parent, or a stronger motivation of coming to the US to gain education rather than employment. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Within each labor force, we looked further at the percentage of each group that was able to find employment, and those that were unemployed as of the end of 2014:
                    </p>

                    <figure>
                        <figcaption>Employment Rates by Origin:</figcaption>
                        <img src='img/employment_rates.png' width="100%">
                    </figure>

                    <p>
                        The above pie charts reveal a few interesting factors. North Americans have the lowest rate of unemployment, which is interesting but understandable, as the amount of immigrants from other North American countries (this dataset places Mexico in Latin America) is relatively low. It is possible that they may also only emigrate once they have secured employment, but there is no way of knowing for sure. African immigrants have an extremely high rate of unemployment relative to other groups. I don't know enough about the reasons behind emigration from this continent, so it requires further exploration in order to formulate a well-founded hypothesis. 
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        Perhaps most significant is that Asians, despite having the highest concentration of immigrants in the labor force (and overall), have the second lowest rate of unemployment. My hypothesis is that this is very likely due to the types of jobs they go into. So, that is the next data I looked at:
                    </p>

                    <figure>
                        <figcaption>Labor Breakdown by Origin:</figcaption>
                        <img src='img/labor_breakdown.png' width="80%">
                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        The graph above shows a breakdown of the percentage of a given group's labor force in terms of type of employment. What stands out immediately is the fact that the percentage of North Americans in management, business, science, and arts is more than double the percentage of the total US immigrant labor force in those fields. These fields (with the possible exception of the arts) also tend to be more secure and in demand, possibly accounting for the low rate of unemployment for North Americans. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The next highest represented group in this field is Asian immigrants. Especially considering events such as the tech boom in Silicon Valley and constant demand for those in STEM fields, it could make sense that it is easier for Asians to gain employment than groups with fewer people going into these fields. Our data also stands consistent with the fact that an overwhelming majority of immigrants in their mid-20's from Asia emigrate to the US in order to complete a master's degree or gain employment.  
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Finally, keeping the employment visualizations in mind, we looked at income breakdowns for each group:
                    </p>

                    <figure>
                        <figcaption>Income Breakdown by Origin:</figcaption>
                            <img src='img/income_breakdown.png' width="80%">
                    </figure>

                    <p>
                        In the year of 2014, around 46% of immigrants from North American countries earned $75,000 and up, which is nearly <i>2.5</i> times more than the percentage of the entire US labor force in that income bracket. Given their low unemployment rate and high percentage of people in high-paying jobs, this makes sense. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Both immigrants from Oceania and Asia also have large percentages of people in the highest income bracket, which is once again understandable due to the fields they tend to go into. African immigrants, on the other hand, have almost equal representations of people in each income bracket (with the exception of the two lowest brackets, which they are below average).
                    </p>

                    <h3>Looking Into Asia</h3>
                    <p> 
                        Because Asia is so diverse from region to region, and accounts for nearly 1/3 of the total immigrants in the US, we were particularly interested in looking at this group in more depth to learn how it differed within itself. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We looked at the same factors, beginning with a breakdown of percentage in labor force and not in labor force:
                    </p>

                    <figure>
                        <figcaption>Labor Force Breakdown by Region:</figcaption>
                        <img src='img/asian_pop_labor_force.png' width="100%">
                    </figure>

                    <p>
                        At once, we can see that the different areas of Asia are going to be represented very differently in our data. West Asians and East Asians have slightly lower representation in the labor force (though still well above 50%), while South Central Asians and South Eastern Asians are more significantly in the labor force. Only around 1/3 of these groups are not in the labor force, indicating higher average age of immigrants or more educational attainment before immigrating. 
                    </p>

                    <figure>
                        <figcaption>Employment Breakdown by Region:</figcaption>
                        <img src='img/asian_employment_rates.png' width="100%">
                    </figure>

                    <p>
                        Looking at the breakdown of the labor force by employment (above), we see that West Asians have a very high rate of unemployment, while immigrants from the other three regions do much better in finding employment.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Next, we looked at a breakdown of fields for each group's labor force:
                    </p>

                    <figure>
                        <figcaption>Labor Breakdown by Region:</figcaption>
                        <img src='img/asian_labor_breakdown.png' width="80%">
                    </figure>

                    <p>
                        Compared to the total US immigrant labor force, each region of Asia is well above the overall percentage of immigrants in management, business, science, and arts fields. Interestingly, more than half of South Central Asians go into these fields. Looking back at the map of Asian regions, this provides some insight as to why Indians, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, and other immigrants from these countries came to the US. Something else that would be interesting to learn more about is why South Eastern Asians seem to go into service fields more than other Asian groups.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once again, we looked at a detailed breakdown of earnings in 2014 for each region:
                    </p>

                    <figure>
                        <figcaption>Income Breakdown by Region:</figcaption>
                            <img src='img/asian_income_breakdown.png' width="80%">
                    </figure>

                    <p>
                        This again showed a pretty direct correlation to field of employment as we can see that South Central Asians were most represented in business and science fields, and also in the highest income bracket. Interestingly enough, South Central Asian and North American immigrants seem to share very similar representations in both topics. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Given West Asians' representation in sales, business, and science fields, it is surprising that they have the highest percentage of people in the two lowest income brackets. However, this could make sense due to their higher rate of unemployment. South East Asians are the most equally represented among the five higher income brackets, and among the fields of labor as well.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Overall, looking at income and employment has raised countless questions about causation and correlation, some of which we hope to answer by looking at educational attainment.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Education Obtained</h2>
                    <h3> School Enrollment Breakdown for Year 2014 </h3>

                    <p>First we explored the school enrollement for all people born in Asia, Eastern Asia, South Central Asia, and Western Asia for the year 2014. The data table says that there are 483,655 Asians attending school in 2014. Out of those 483,655, below is the break down of how many students are in nursery school, elementary school, high school, or college. <p> 

                    <p>The data for the rest of the foreign born people born in Asia looks like this: 
                    <table>
                        <tr> <td> <b> Foreign Born People </b></td> <td> <b> Total Attending School </b> </td> </tr>
                        <tr> <td> Born in Asia </td> <td> 2,092,371 </td> </tr>

                    <p> Now we can look at which grades people from these groups are attending. The data set had the percentage of total people born in each area listed above attending nursery school, elementary school, high school, or college. </p>

                    <figure align = 'center'> 
                            <figcaption> The number of foreign born people born all around Asia attending these different grades. </figcaption>

                    <p>According to this breakdown, a very small number of children are enrolled in nursery school, but a large number are enrolled in college. This tells us that children that immigrate to the United States are old enough to attend elementary school or college, but not nursery school. Oddly enough, there are consistently more children enrolled in elementary school or college than there are enrolled in high school, though high school is not optional once you get to America. Therefore, this might speak to two "waves" of immigrants, those that come for elementary school and stay until or past college, and then those that come as part of their college studies. <p>


                    <figure align = 'center'> 
                            <figcaption> Foreign born people from Africa, Northern America, and Oceania attending these different grades. </figcaption>

                    </figure>

                    <p>A very small number of children born in Africa, Northern America, and Oceania are in nursery school. Again, this is likely due to the fact that parents do not immigrate with children until they are a bit older than nursery school age. The majority of Africans, Northern Americans, and Oceanics are enrolled in college. Again, more students are enrolled in elementary school or college than high school. This is intriguing. Therefore, we should keep exploring and comparing these data sets. Particularly, let us zoom in on college and higher education. </p>

                    <h3> Degrees Obtained Breakdown for Asians in the year 2014</h3>

                    The data set contains the percentages of Asians, Eastern Asians, South Central Asians, South Eastern Asians, and Western Asians that have less than a high school degree in education, a high school degree, some college like an associates degree, a bachelors degree, and a graduate degree. 

                    We can plot the percentage of Asian people that have obtained each type of degree. 

                    <p>
                        <figure align = 'center'> 
                            <figcaption> Degrees obtained of Asians for year 2014 </figcaption>
                            <img src = 'img/degrees_obtained_by_asians.png' width = "100%">
                        </figure>
                    </p>

                     We noticed that South Eastern people have the majority in the less than high school education group. They are, however, the second highest group in a bachelors degree. However, they more than 15% lower than the average for graduate degrees. South Eastern Asians go to school, but very few of them become professions that require phDs. The people from South Central Asia consistently have the least number of people with less than high school degrees and high school degrees. On those lines, they also consistently have the highest number of people with the majority of bachelor and graduate degrees. 

                    Plotting the data is always tricky because a good plot is easy to read and provides all the information in the way that the point comes across. Well what is the easiest way to read this data? And what is  our point? We were just playing around and we also chose to plot the percentage of the people from different regions acquiring these degrees.

                    <figure align = 'center'> 
                            <figcaption> Educational Attainment of Asians for year 2014 </figcaption>
                            <img src = 'img/educational_obtainment_of_asians_2014.png' width = "100%">
                    </figure>

                    This plot above tells us that out of all the foreign born members from Asia, the around 27% are acquiring their bachelors degree. For all of the members born in Eastern Asia, around 28% and 26% are acquiring their bachelors and graduate degree, respectively. However, these values are at a low in comparison to the other regions, when it comes to bachelors degrees. South Central Asians have almost 35% of their foreign born population acquiring a graduate degree and around 30% for a bachelors degree. Their values for the rest of the degrees are low, around 10%. Therefore, this means that South Central Asians likely come to the United States for undergraduate and graduate studies. South Eastern Asian people have the highest some college, out of all of the regions. Some college means technical schooling or an associate's degree. 

                    <h3> Degrees Obtained Breakdown for Africans, Northern Americans, and Oceanics in the year 2014</h3>

                    <p> Similarly we can analyze the education attainment for the populations of Africa, Northern Americans, and Oceanics for the year 2014. We can plot the percentage of each foreign born group that obtains each degree. </p>
                    <figure align = 'center'> 
                            <figcaption> Educational Attainment of Africans, Northern Americans (not including the US), and Oceanics for year 2014 </figcaption>
                            <img src = 'img/educational_obtainment_of_african_na_and_oceanic_2014.png' width = "100%">
                    </figure>

                    <p> 
                    This plot looks like a Gaussian curve or a bell curve. The peak for each foreign born population is at “some college” like technical college or an associate's degree. All three groups have around 28% of the population under some college category. Then at the extremes like “less than a high school” degree of education and a “graduate degree”, foreign born populations have their lowest percentages of people representing in one or the other group. The Oceanic population has the majority of their population in the two groups: HS education (around 25%)and some college (around 28%). The Northern American population group has the majority of their people in the two groups: some college (28%) and bachelors degree (24%). The African population also has the majority of their people in the “some college” and “bachelor’s degree” grouping, but with 28% in the some college category and 23% with a bachelors degree. The majority of the people immigrating from these regions only get through some college. Perhaps education is not their main motivation for coming to the United States. Or perhaps for other circumstances, they have had to drop out of college. Or perhaps the American style of college is different in other parts of the world. The American college education system is probably not too different from Northern America, however, this might not hold true for other countries. There is a lot of speculation on the “why” after presenting the data. 

                    </p>

                    <h2>What Can We Learn?</h2>
                    <p>
                        If we analyze both areas together, we can see a definite correlation between income, employment, and level of education. Looking at Asian regions, We can see that South Central Asians make the most income, out of all of the groups we have looked at so far, with around 48% of them making $75,000 and up yearly. If we look at the education level for immigrants from South Central Asia, we can see that they are the people that obtain the most graduate degrees. This is usually a correlation we can see from people in the United States: the higher the level of education, the more income. Additionally, we can see that there are less South Eastern Asians than any other group in higher income groups. Fewer of them earn $75000 and up. On an education level, South Eastern Asians earn an average amount of bachelor’s degrees (around 26%). They also obtain the least graduate degrees out of all of the groups. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For Africa and Northern American and Oceanic: 
                        Northern Americans earn the most money out of any other group, and drastically above average for the entire US. On an education level, the data shows that Northern Americans, out of all of the other groups, obtain the most number of higher education degrees. They have the most some college, as well as bachelors and graduate degrees completed.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
                    <p>
                        First, we would like to continue exploring these same topics (income, industry, and education) for the other data sets that the American Community Survey provides. More specifically, we would like to explore the foreign born populations of Latin America and Europe. We imagine that this process will go quicker now that we have code written to acquire the data at the specific cells and code to plot the graphs.  
                    </p>
                    <p> Second, we would like to "zoom out" by 1 and compare all of the foreign born populations for the year 2014 to see if there were any trends there or who had the most immigration or made the most money or completed the highest degree out of all of the foreign born populations in the year 2014. </p>

                    <p>Third, we would like to zoom out even more and plot all of these trends over time. Through this, we will look at how the industries each foreign born population worked in has changed over time, starting from 2005, how their income level has changed over time from 2005, and how many of them have obtained bachelors or graduate degrees over time. We will try to identify trends in this group. In this step we would also like to explore the number of immigrants that have been naturalized and compare those to immigrants that are in the process of gaining citizenship or have arrived illegally.  </p>

                    <p> We would then like to begin looking at other factors that encompass lifestyle, including living conditions, areas in the US they live in, and crime rates.</p>

                    <p> Finally, we would like to bask in our data collection and identify a story for each topic or each foreign born population and create appropriate visualizations.</p>
