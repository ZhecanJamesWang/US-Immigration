schools solution disastrous conditions prevented percent student body meeting basic proficiency standards obviously required massive improvements unrelated voucher program course emergency may given families powerful motivation leave public school system accept religious indoctrination would otherwise avoided valid reason upholding program second wide range choices made available students within public school system bearing question whether state may pay tuition students wish reject public education entirely attend private schools provide sectarian education fact vast majority voucher recipients entirely rejected public education receive religious indoctrination state expense however support claim law one respecting establishment religion state may choose divide public schools dozen different options label magnet schools community schools whatever else decides call state still required provide public education state decision fund private school education traditional obligation issue cases third voluntary character private choice prefer parochial education education public school system seems quite irrelevant question whether government choice pay religious indoctrination constitutionally permissible today however court seems decided mere fact family cannot afford private education wants children educated parochial school sufficient justification use
