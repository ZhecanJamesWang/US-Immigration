        <div class="title">A Shift of Opinions: Immigration and the United States</div>
        This election cycle has once again cast a limelight upon the issue of immigration in the United States, referencing both legal and undocumented immigrants, and even refugees fleeing war-torn countries. It’s amazing that we take the rhetoric that some politicians display as the norm nowadays, since 30 years ago, this debate was aired.

        <div class="title">Immigration Fluctuation</div>
        It's not only rhetoric that has varied greatly over the years. Immigration rates themselves have fluctuated greatly in recent years, varying by over 150 million in the past thirty years alone.
        <br></br>
        When did the United States' attitude towards immigrants become so polarized, and sometimes hostile? It's necessary to investigate this question through multiple routes.

      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">Routes of Investigation</div>
          One is through the <b>Congressional Bills</b> which pertained to immigration. This provided us with a view of the legislative view of the government’s attitude towards immigration.
          <br></br>
          Second was through archived <b>New York Times</b> articles which contained the word immigration. This let us view immigration through the lens of the general public and (in this case mostly liberal) media.
          <br></br>
           Finally, we found very interesting significant statistics published by the <b>Department of Homeland Security</b>. This gave us a perspective on the executive actions of the government.

      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">Taking a closer look into Bills</div>
        We decided to zoom into the early 1990's till 2005, as Congress data prior to those dates appear deprecated.
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">Unique Bills</div>
        Although there were numerous amendments to bills, we were able to extract the first version of those bills related to immigration and, hence, collect 114 unique documents to process.
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">What are they about</div>
        After obtaining the content of the bills we collected their top_subject terms via TF-IDF and also by consulting with the words listed in the dataset that matched our predicions.
        <br></br>
        We were very interested in exploring the topic of Economics and Finance, as it was the most frequent one.

        <div class="title">The Executive</div>
        By investigating data surrounding the Department of Homeland Security, we tried to gain a very important perspective into the issue of the United States’ executive stance on immigration. There are many different statistics released by the DHS, and part of
